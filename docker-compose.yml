  # Frontend service for development (using Vite dev server) or build integration
  # For this setup, we'll try to build frontend and serve via nginx,
  # or running it as a dev server proxied by nginx.
  # Given the prompt implies immediate usability, a dev server is easier for iteration.
  # But the README architecture shows Nginx -> App. It doesn't explicitly show a Node container.
  # To match "App Container (Go)" serving everything or Nginx serving static,
  # I will stick to Nginx serving static files built from frontend.
  # So I will add a build stage in frontend or just mount the dist.
  # For now, let's keep frontend as a separate service for development if needed,
  # but strictly following the README, likely Nginx serves frontend assets.

  # For Development, running frontend separately is better.

    ports:

    volumes:
      - ./nginx/certs:/etc/nginx/certs
      # Mount frontend dist if we were building it.
      # For dev, we might verify connection to frontend container?
      # The README says Nginx -> App (Go).
      # If Go app only provides API, who serves HTML? Nginx.
      # So Nginx needs access to frontend build artifacts.
